1️⃣ What You Are Running

You are running:

sudo build-root/install-vpp-native/vpp/bin/vpp \
  -c build-root/install-vpp-native/vpp/etc/vpp/startup.conf

This means:

You built VPP from source

You are running the VPP binary directly from the build directory

You are explicitly passing a custom startup.conf

This is called:

🔹 Running VPP from source build (development mode)

This is completely correct.

2️⃣ What sudo vppctl Actually Does

vppctl is NOT VPP.

It is just the CLI client tool.

Architecture:
+----------------+
|     vppctl     |  <-- CLI client
+----------------+
        |
        |  (socket connection)
        v
+----------------+
|      VPP       |  <-- Main dataplane process
+----------------+

So when you do:

sudo vppctl

It connects to:

/run/vpp/cli.sock

But this only works if:

VPP is already running in background

Usually started via systemd service:

sudo systemctl start vpp

So:

Command	What it does
vpp	Starts VPP process
vppctl	Connects to running VPP
3️⃣ What Your Friend Is Doing (make run-release)

When your friend runs:

make run-release

That is from inside VPP source directory.

This does:

Build release version

Start VPP

Attach CLI automatically

Internally it runs something similar to:

./build-root/install-vpp-native/vpp/bin/vpp

So it's just a helper command for developers.

4️⃣ Different Ways to Run VPP

There are 3 common ways:

🔹 Method 1 — Installed Package Mode

If VPP is installed via:

sudo apt install vpp

Then:

sudo systemctl start vpp
sudo vppctl

This is production mode.

Binary location:

/usr/bin/vpp
🔹 Method 2 — Build From Source (What You’re Doing)

Binary location:

build-root/install-vpp-native/vpp/bin/vpp

You manually start:

sudo ./vpp -c startup.conf

This is development/testing mode.

🔹 Method 3 — make run-release (Developer Shortcut)

Runs VPP directly from source build.

Mostly used by:

VPP contributors

Developers modifying VPP code

5️⃣ Are You Using Wrong VPP?

❌ No.

You are using:

Source-built VPP (developer mode)

Your friend is using:

Same source build but via make helper command

Earlier when you used sudo vppctl, that was probably:

Installed VPP from apt (system-wide)

6️⃣ How To Check Which VPP You’re Using

Run:

which vpp

If it shows:

/usr/bin/vpp

→ That is installed version

If not found:
→ You are only using source-built VPP

Also check version:

vppctl show version

You earlier showed:

vpp v25.10

So your source build is working fine.

7️⃣ Important Internal Difference
When you run:
sudo vppctl

You are:

Connecting to an already running VPP process

When you run:
sudo build-root/.../vpp

You are:

Starting a NEW VPP instance

Big difference.

8️⃣ When Should You Use Each?

Since you're studying internals (DPDK, graph nodes, packet path etc.), you SHOULD use:

✅ Source build mode (what you’re doing)

Because:

You can modify source

You can debug

You can trace internal function calls

You can experiment with DPDK integration

9️⃣ Summary Table
Method	Type	Used For
sudo vppctl	CLI client	Connect to running VPP
sudo vpp	Start VPP	Manual run
make run-release	Dev helper	Auto run from source
systemctl start vpp	Service mode	Production
🔥 Final Answer

You did NOT install wrong VPP.

You are simply running:

Source-built VPP manually

Your friend is just using a shortcut provided by the build system.

Both are valid.
