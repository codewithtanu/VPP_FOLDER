1️⃣ vppinfra (Basic Tools Layer)
What is it?

vppinfra is the basic tools library.

It does NOT know anything about:

IP

TCP

Ethernet

Packets

It only provides:

Fast memory management

Arrays (vectors)

Hash tables

Pools

Timers

Simple Example

Imagine you are building networking software.

Before handling packets, you need:

Memory

Data storage

Fast lookup tables

That is what vppinfra gives.

So:

👉 vppinfra = helper tools to build fast software

Without it, VPP cannot work fast.

2️⃣ vlib (The Engine)
What is it?

vlib is the main engine of VPP.

It:

Runs the main loop

Executes nodes

Passes packets from one stage to another

Simple Understanding

When a packet comes from NIC:

It goes like this:

Node 1 → Node 2 → Node 3 → Node 4

Each node:

Receives many packets

Processes them

Sends them to next node

This “node system” is created by vlib.

So in simple words:

👉 vlib = the machine that moves packets step by step

It does NOT decide routing.
It only runs the processing engine.

3️⃣ vnet (Networking Logic)
What is it?

vnet is where actual networking happens.

Here you find:

IPv4

IPv6

ARP

Routing

NAT

ACL

VLAN

Tunnels

Simple Example

When you type in VPP:

set interface ip address Gig0/0/0 10.0.0.1/24

That logic is inside vnet.

When packet needs routing:

IP lookup

FIB lookup

Rewrite MAC

All that code is in vnet.

So in simple words:

👉 vnet = networking brain

It decides:

Where packet goes

How it is modified

Whether it is dropped

🔥 Simple Big Picture

When a packet comes:

NIC → vppinfra → vlib → vnet → vlib → NIC

But more correctly:

vppinfra → provides tools
vlib → runs packet engine
vnet → applies networking logic
📌 One-Line Meaning

vppinfra = basic fast data structures

vlib = packet processing engine

vnet = networking features
